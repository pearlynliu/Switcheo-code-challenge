1. The interfaces `WalletBalance` and `FormattedWalletBalance` have common properties. It might be better to have `FormattedWalletBalance` extend from `WalletBalance`, such that `FormattedWalletBalance` will only have the additional property of `formatted: string`. This is to ensure type coherence since `FormattedWalletBalance` is likely a formatted version of `WalletBalance`, hence it helps to organize the code logically.

Should there be a need to update the `WalletBalance` interface in the future by adding or modifying properties, `FormattedWalletBalance` will automatically reflect those changes since it extends `WalletBalance`. This makes it easier to maintain the codebase as it evolves.

2. If there are no additional properties that are needed to go along with `BoxProps`, then there is no need initialise the interface `Props` to extend from `BoxProps`. Currently, there are no properties under `Props`, meaning that the `Props` interface could be removed, and the properties of `BoxProps` can be used directly. This can help to simplify the code and avoid redundancy.

3. The component receives `children` as a `prop` but doesn't appear to use it. If it is not used, it's better to omit them from the component's `props` to reduce clutter.

4. As the `getPriority` function takes in `blockchain` as an argument, it might be best to have a `blockchain` property under the `WalletBalance` interface to ensure that `balance.blockchain`, `lhs.blockchain` and `rhs.blockchain` will be able to return a value under the `sortedBalances` function.

5. Under the `sortedBalances` function, an undefined variable `lhsPriority` is used. The variable that should be used is `balancePriority` which is defined in the line above the `if` statement. 

6. A rather trivial change to the code under `sortedBalances` is to combine the two `if` statements using `&&`. This can help make the code cleaner. --> if (balancePriority > -99 && balance.amount <= 0) { ... }

7. While using `useMemo` is a good practice for memoization, it can be overused. In this case, the entire `sortedBalances` array is recalculated every time `balances` or `prices` change, which may not be necessary. Since the array is sorted based on their `blockchain` priority, that can be retrieved by using the function `getPriority`, the array should only recalculated when this priority value is changed. Since the `filter` function also depends on `balance.amount`, this could be another factor taken into consideration for the recalculation of the `sortedBalances` array.

8. The sorting function sort is not efficient because it calls the `getPriority` function multiple times for the same items, which can be avoided. Instead, a function could be created to assign a `priority` value to each `balance`. The sorting function will then sort the `balances` based on the `priority` property.

It assumes that certain dependencies have yet to be imported, or are not included in the file.
